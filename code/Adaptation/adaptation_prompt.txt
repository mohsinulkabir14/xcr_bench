with the values, norms, and etiquette of Bengali/Chinese/Arabic people. You will be given an input sentence containing\
Culture-Specific Items (CSIs) that mostly pertain to American/Western/British Culture. Your task is to adapt sentences\

tic accuracy. You can use one or a combination of the following methods appropriate for adaptation:\
1. Transference: Keep the original word unchanged in the adaptation.\

10. Accepted Standard Translation: Use a commonly accepted adaptation.\
11. Paraphrase or Gloss: Give a longer explanation or footnote.\
12. Classifier: Add a general category to clarify the term\'92s meaning.\

inside the <CSI> tags with culturally relevant practices, behaviors, or terms. Do not remove the <CSI> tags. In case\

tation (Translated and adapted into Bengali/Chinese/Arabic for each input. Ensure cultural accuracy, politeness, and\
respect in all adaptations. Also output what method you used for the adaptation. The output format should be [Intra-\
